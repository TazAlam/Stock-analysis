# Project 1 - Descriptive Analysis of NASDAQ Historic Stock Data

* Raw data containing over 332,000 observations across 8 variables was first cleaned and reduced, where we then identified the characteristics of the datasets and classify stock data into Healthcare, Information Technology (IT), and Finance industry sectors.
* Critically analysed the data to detect any correlation between the stocks types and potential trends.
* Subsequently deduced the stock type which is most volatile, along with other defining characteristics.


# Project 2 - Predicting Death Event In Patients With Heart Problems Using NeuralNet

* Performed preliminary analysis using data visualisation in R to establish correlation in the raw data which contained 299 rows with 13 variables.
* Conducted Data Reduction techniques (PCA & FAMD) to deduce the variables of importance, to subsequently reduce noise.
* Carried our further data-preprocessing to then create several Neural Network models (of varying depths) using NeuralNet to predict the Death Event (target variable). 
* With the use of confusion matrices, we established that whilst first model returned ‘Test Accuracy’ of 77%, final model returned prediction accuracy on Test data of 81%.
