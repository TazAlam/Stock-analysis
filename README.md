# Project 1 - Descriptive Analysis of NASDAQ Historic Stock Data

* Raw data containing over 332,000 observations across 8 variables was first cleaned and reduced, where we then identified the characteristics of the datasets and classify stock data into Healthcare, Information Technology (IT), and Finance industry sectors.
* Critically analysed the data to detect any correlation between the stocks types and potential trends.
* Subsequently deduced the stock type which is most volatile, along with other defining characteristics.
